        <p>
          Out of band authentication (OOBA) refers to an authentication process that utilizes a communications channel that is separate 
          from the primary communication channel used by two entities trying to establish an authenticated connection. Using a separate 
          authentication channel makes it significantly more difficult for an attacker to intercept and subvert 
          the authentication process (i.e. via man-in-the-middle attack), because it requires the attacker to compromise two communications channels.

        <h2><u>Forms of OOBA:</u></h2>
        <p>
          Example forms of OOB authentication include, codes sent to a mobile device via SMS, authentication via a voice channel, codes sent 
          to a mobile app via push notifications, and codes sent to or received from a trusted execution environment connected to the host device 
          trying to establish an authenticated connection (i.e. TEE implemented
          by the CPU, a separate secure element built into the host or a separate secure element connected to the host via USB or some other port).

        <h2><u>SMS OOBA:</u></h2>
        <p>
          OOBA is commonly used by online banking websites. To complete the login process, an authentication code is sent via SMS 
          to the account holderâ€™s mobile device.
