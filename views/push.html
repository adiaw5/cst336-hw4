          With push authentication technology, a push notification is sent to the user mobile device every time an attempt is made to login 
          to application. The request goes through the approval process wherein the user is presented with “approve or deny.” Upon approval,
          a new OTP is automatically generated by the token app and sent to the protected resource, eliminating password fatigue as well as 
          the need to manually generate and enter OTPs. Notifications can be sent in-band or out-of-band, using any number of communications 
          channels. Push authentication ensures that the device registered with the authentication server, including mobile device and similar 
          device, is in fact in the user’s possession. If the device is compromised by an attacker, then push notifications are compromised. 
          Authentication based on push notifications is gaining popularity because it provides a simple means to authenticate users, 
          especially if used without passwords.

        <span style="color:red">What are the advantages of push notification authentication?</span>
        Push authentication validates login attempts by forwarding the authentication requests to an associated mobile device. Once a mobile 
        device is enrolled, the user trigger a push notification whenever he or she tries to log into an application. The user is only required
        to supply the username or ID and leave the password field blank or enter a character depending on the configuration, then the user 
        receives an access request notification on the user’s smartphone, which the user can approve or decline. The benefits of push 
        notification authentication out weight its inconvenience. For example, with push authentication the user no longer needs to manage 
        password. Furthermore, the notification as design to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience. In general validating 
        authentication request could be done in one touch which is better than typing a complex password. Many companies including Thales, 
        Google, Microsoft, etc… provide push token to protect various application such Google suits, vpn clients logins, Outlook 365,  etc…
